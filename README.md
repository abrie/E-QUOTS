# E-QUOTS

This is a [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) implementation of the PDF-based [QUOTS](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/tools/quots.html).

## Background

Infection control is a serious concern in health care facilities. The [CDC](https://cdc.gov) and [APIC](http://https://www.apic.org) developed a set of [Infection Prevention Observation Tools](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/tools/quots.html) to augment best practices. Known as QUOTS (Quick Observation Tools). The worksheets are available through the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/tools/quots.html) or [APIC](https://ipcobservationtools.site.apic.org/observation-tools-library/).

## Motivation

The worksheets are PDF documents. They must be printed, completed, and archived by hand. This project provides a paperless alternative.

## Implementation

E-QUOTS is a web app; an electronic version of QUOTS with automatic tabulation and export features. It requires no proprietary software or downloads. Here is a screen shot:

A completed form may be printed or emailed.

## Legal Details

APIC and CDC created the original PDFs using funding from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Contract (#200-2016-89676).

This project is not affiliated with APIC or the CDC.
