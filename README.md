## Background

Infection control is a serious concern in health care facilities. The [CDC](https://cdc.gov) and [APIC](http://https://www.apic.org) developed a set of [Infection Prevention Observation Tools](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/tools/quots.html) to augment best practices. Known as QUOTS (Quick Observation Tools). The worksheets are available through the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/tools/quots.html) or [APIC](https://ipcobservationtools.site.apic.org/observation-tools-library/).

## Motivation

The worksheets provided by CDC are PDF documents. They must be printed, completed, and archived by hand. This project provides a paperless alternative.

# E-QUOTS

This is a [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) implementation of the PDF-based [QUOTS](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/tools/quots.html).

## Implementation

E-QUOTS is a web app; an electronic version of QUOTS with automatic tabulation and export features. It requires no proprietary software or downloads. It works offline.

Completed forms may be printed or emailed, which makes them easy to integrate into a tracking system.

## The App

## Legal Details

APIC and CDC created the original PDFs using funding from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Contract (#200-2016-89676).

This project is not affiliated with APIC or the CDC.
